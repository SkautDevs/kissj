# Possible problems & fixes

#### STMP connection error

 - if TLS is not working correctly (for gmail especially), try set `'SMTPAuth' => false` and/or `'disable_tls' => true`

#### Local mail service

 - use Mailhog at `http://localhost:8025/`

#### User cannot log in - after click it stays on "insert mail" page

 - try what function `session_start()` returns
 - if false, it probably cannot write session into filesystem
 - make path from `session_save_path()` writable
