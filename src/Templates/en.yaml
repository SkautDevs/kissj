Subsequently you receive an E-mail with a button and a link to sign in. When following the links you will immediately be able to fill in the registration form. </p><p>You stay logged in until you manually log out. </p><p>After logging out, nobody can access your data, not even from the same device. </p><p>For logging back in and accessing your data, you have to submit your E-mail address at the log-in page again. Your will receive another button/link into your E-mail account to follow, just like when signing in for the first time. </p><h3>Expiration of access button/link</h3><p>The received button/link is valid only for 15 minutes. Later on you would have to submit your E-mail address again to get a new logging-in button/link. This is a protection against anyone, who could somehow get access to your old E-mails - so that the data you submitted into the registration system are not accessible via an old link. </p><p>The button/link is valid for one use only. Therefore if you log in and out in a short period of time, you cannot access the registration account with the same link again and have to get a new one. </p><p>All these security elements have one main goal - to keep your data as secure as possible, just like the banks and other big portals attempt to do it. </p><h3>Questions?</h3><p>Should there be any issue with logging in or with any other part of the system, write an E-mail to the particular event organizers, they will surely try to help you at their best. </p>"
